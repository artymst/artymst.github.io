<h3>Overview:</h3>

PhysicsGraphPy<SUP><FONT SIZE="-1">TM</FONT></SUP> is a beginner-friendly Python library for simulating and visualizing motion in physics. With this library, you can easily create and analyze kinematics and projectile motion scenarios, generate position, velocity, and acceleration graphs, as well as animate motion using simple code. PhysicsGraphPy is ideal for students, educators, and anyone exploring basic physics concepts programmatically.

This package is distributed under the MIT License and is available for manual installation directly from this website. Just download the installation files and follow the provided instructions to start experimenting with motion graphs and physics simulations in your own Python projects.<br><br>


<h3>Features:</h3>

PhysicsGraphPy offers a rich set of features for exploring motion in physics. It supports simulation of free-fall, kinematics, and projectile trajectories, allowing you to analyze movement with custom parameters. The library can generate easy-to-read position, velocity, and acceleration graphs, and also provides animation tools to visualize motion step by step. With built-in calculators for quantities like maximum height, time of flight, and range, as well as options to export data in CSV or Markdown format, PhysicsGraphPy makes it simple to study and present physics concepts. For added flexibility, the package includes unit conversion tools, SI unit checking, and options to customize graph styles—all designed to streamline physics experiments and learning in Python.

<br><br>

<h3>Requirements:</h3>

To use PhysicsGraphPy, you need to have Python 3.7 or higher installed on your computer. The library also requires the popular matplotlib and numpy packages for graphing and numerical calculations. Before installing PhysicsGraphPy, make sure these dependencies are available, or simply use pip to handle the installation automatically. No other specialized software is required—just a standard Python environment is enough to start simulating and visualizing motion in physics with this package.

<br><br>


<h3>Supported systems:</h3>

PhysicsGraphPy is designed to work on all major operating systems that support Python, including Windows, macOS, and most Linux distributions. As long as you have a compatible version of Python installed, along with the necessary dependencies, you can use PhysicsGraphPy on desktop or laptop computers. The library is intended for standard desktop Python environments and may not be fully compatible with limited mobile or browser-based interpreters.<br><br>

<h3>Main Commands:</h3>

PhysicsGraphPy offers a set of intuitive commands to make simulating and plotting motion in physics easy for beginners and advanced users alike. Below are the main functions and classes you’ll use when working with this library:<br>

<br>
<strong>Commands</strong><br><br>

MotionGraph - Create and simulate basic motion.
<pre>
obj = MotionGraph(10, 0, -9.8)  # start at 10 m, 0 m/s, gravity
obj.simulate(3)
</pre><br>
  
ProjectileMotion - Model and analyze projectile trajectories.
<pre>
pm = ProjectileMotion(20, 45)  # 20 m/s at 45 degrees
pm.simulate(pm.time_of_flight())
</pre><br>

plot_all – Plot position, velocity, and acceleration graphs

<pre> plot_all(obj) </pre><br>

plot_projectile – Plot the path of a projectile

<pre> plot_projectile(pm) </pre><br>

<pre> plot_projectile(pm) </pre><br>
animate_motion – Animate how an object moves

<pre> animate_motion(obj) </pre><br>

export_csv – Export simulation data to a CSV file

<pre> export_csv("free_fall.csv", obj.times, obj.positions, obj.velocities) </pre><br>

convert_units – Convert between common units

<pre> meters = convert_units(100, "cm", "m") # returns: 1.0 </pre><br>

format_markdown – Convert results to Markdown format for reports

<pre> summary = format_markdown("Results", {"Max Height": 10, "Range": 40}) </pre><br>

check_si_units – Check if a unit is a standard SI unit

<pre> check_si_units("m", "m") # No error if SI </pre><br>

<h3>Education Use:</h3>
PhysicsGraphPy is an excellent tool for educational purposes, making it easy for students and teachers to explore and visualize fundamental physics concepts. With its simple commands, clear graphing features, and animation capabilities, the library helps learners better understand motion, acceleration, and projectile dynamics through hands-on coding. Its intuitive design allows users to quickly create, simulate, and analyze experiments, making PhysicsGraphPy a valuable resource for classrooms, homework, and self-guided study in physics education.<BR><BR><br>
