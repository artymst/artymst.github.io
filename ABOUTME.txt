Hey there!
I'm an experimental developer who loves building things that mix creativity, code, and education.
I’ve worked on NovaScript, my own simple, educational programming language built to help people understand how coding works from the ground up.

🧠 What I Do

Language Design: Created NovaScript, an easy-to-learn educational coding language that encourages experimentation and learning.
Web Development: Explore web-first tools and technologies for interactive learning experiences.
Graphic & UI/UX Design: Craft clean, functional designs using Figma, Framer, and Vercel.
Creative Experiments: I enjoy pushing the limits of what’s possible with minimal tools and lots of curiosity.

💡 Projects
